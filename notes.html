<!-- why Start with ARRAYS -->
<!-- this is b/c they are required and pivotal in ebery website, database, web applications... etc -->
<!-- for our immediete use arrays are required to easily populate websites -->
<!-- to master arrays you will need some tools first -->
<!-- ternaries -->
<!-- this is just a quick reminder abt how ternaries work, thinsk of them as small if statements -->
<!-- {conditional ? truePath : falsePath} -->
<!-- The Spread operator -->
<!-- the spread operator(...) will iterate through and add all values from an array-like object -->
<!-- book = {
    title: 'coding',
    pages: 123,
    cover: 'hard-cover'
} -->
<!-- Book version 2 will have all the same values but we changed pages to 140 and added an author property -->
<!-- bookV2 = {
    ...book,
    pages: 140,
    author: 'Steve'
} -->
<!-- Mapping arrays -->
<!-- when you have an array w/ several items that you want to break down the best way is .map()  -->
<!-- .map() is an array mthod that will go through each of the items and do a thing -->
<!-- the nice part of .map( is that it returns a whole new array when it's finsished) -->
<!-- other methods such as forEach() do not create new arrays and instead just paste content fot the existing array  -->
<!-- Anatomy of .map() -->
<!-- let newArray = people.map((person) => {
    const { name, age, job, shirtColor, drink, pet} = person;
    }) -->
    <!-- lastly you need to return the object back from the map. -->
<!-- let newArray = people.map((person) => {
    const { name, age, job, shirtColor, drink, pet} = person;
    }) -->
<!-- return {...person, shirtColor: 'tie-dye', isNice: 'yes'}; -->
<!-- .forEach() -->
<!-- forEach doesn't return an array as an output. -->
<!-- you have 3 values that you can use to work with
    vlaue
    index
    Array(the entire thing)
-->
    <!-- .forEach -->
<!-- the last export of a for each loop is "undefined" this really messes with returning values -->
<!-- instead you can have am conditional that acts depending on the values returned
    counting occurences
    breaking up the array into smaller arrays
    printing out every name that starts with A
-->
<!-- .every()
const numbers = [-1, -2, 20, 40, 50]; -->
<!-- console.log(
    numbers.every((num) => num < 100)
); -->
<!-- .some() -->
<!-- this is very similar to .every but instead of checking all it checks in there are any that are true -->
<!-- as long as one is true this will return a true statement -->
<!-- .reduce() -->
<!-- reduce() is a method that adds to an output, it finds the accumulation of numbers. -->
<!-- this does nothing for non-numbers values, this is very useful for creating updated numbers of items
items in yout cart, money raised by the class-->
<!-- .reduce() Paramaters -->
<!-- const array = [2,4,6,8,10] -->
<!-- array.reduce((accumulator, currentValue, currentIndex, array) => {
    return accumulator + currentValue
}, 20) -->
<!-- Reduce has a lot going on there are 5 things that you can use:
total is a variable that is automatically returned when the method ends -->
<!-- .reduce() Parameters -->
<!-- const array = [2,4,6,8,10] -->
<!-- array.reduce((total, current,index, array) =>
    {
        return total + current
    },20 ) -->
    <!-- current is a variable referring to value currently being looked at
    you can choose how this number will affect the total (here it is added.) -->
    <!-- next is index and array, these are both optional if you dint need them'
    index tell you the index if the current number -->
    <!-- lastly is the optional starting value -->
    <!-- this is outside of the callback function and sets the total value so that you can start at any value -->
