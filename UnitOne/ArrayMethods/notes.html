<!-- why Start with ARRAYS -->
<!-- this is b/c they are required and pivotal in ebery website, database, web applications... etc -->
<!-- for our immediete use arrays are required to easily populate websites -->
<!-- to master arrays you will need some tools first -->
<!-- ternaries -->
<!-- this is just a quick reminder abt how ternaries work, thinsk of them as small if statements -->
<!-- {conditional ? truePath : falsePath} -->
<!-- The Spread operator -->
<!-- the spread operator(...) will iterate through and add all values from an array-like object -->
<!-- book = {
    title: 'coding',
    pages: 123,
    cover: 'hard-cover'
} -->
<!-- Book version 2 will have all the same values but we changed pages to 140 and added an author property -->
<!-- bookV2 = {
    ...book,
    pages: 140,
    author: 'Steve'
} -->
<!-- Mapping arrays -->
<!-- when you have an array w/ several items that you want to break down the best way is .map()  -->
<!-- .map() is an array mthod that will go through each of the items and do a thing -->
<!-- the nice part of .map( is that it returns a whole new array when it's finsished) -->
<!-- other methods such as forEach() do not create new arrays and instead just paste content fot the existing array  -->
<!-- Anatomy of .map() -->
<!-- let newArray = people.map((person) => {
    const { name, age, job, shirtColor, drink, pet} = person;
    }) -->
    <!-- lastly you need to return the object back from the map. -->
<!-- let newArray = people.map((person) => {
    const { name, age, job, shirtColor, drink, pet} = person;
    }) -->
<!-- return {...person, shirtColor: 'tie-dye', isNice: 'yes'}; -->
<!-- .forEach() -->
<!-- forEach doesn't return an array as an output. -->
<!-- you have 3 values that you can use to work with
    vlaue
    index
    Array(the entire thing)
-->
    <!-- .forEach -->
<!-- the last export of a for each loop is "undefined" this really messes with returning values -->
<!-- instead you can have am conditional that acts depending on the values returned
    counting occurences
    breaking up the array into smaller arrays
    printing out every name that starts with A
